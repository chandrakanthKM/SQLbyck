# Car Prices Analysis

This repository contains SQL queries for analyzing car prices dataset.

## Introduction

The provided SQL queries are designed to perform various statistical analyses on a dataset containing information about car prices. These analyses include calculating descriptive statistics, constructing histograms, finding mode, calculating mean, median, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used in these queries contains information about car prices, including attributes such as make, model, year, trim, body type, transmission, VIN, state, condition, odometer reading, color, interior, seller information, MMR (Manheim Market Report), selling price, and sale date.

## Queries

The repository includes SQL queries for the following analyses:

1. Descriptive statistics on car prices.
2. Constructing histograms.
3. Calculating mean using a normalized histogram.
4. Calculating the harmonic mean of selling prices.
5. Finding the mode (most frequent color).
6. Calculating the median selling price.
7. Calculating variance of selling prices.
8. Calculating skewness and kurtosis of selling prices.
9. Count of cars by make and by seller.
10. Calculating entropy and joint probability.
11. Data cleaning operations such as updating state names and standardizing make names.
12. Identifying and handling missing values.
13. Checking for NULL values in the dataset.
14. Identifying unique occurrences and duplicate records.
15. Random sampling from the dataset.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
